**Making Sense of the world around us requires obtaining and analyzing data from our environment**

**Data Science, a new field devoted to maximizing value from vast collections of information**

As a discipline, data science sits somewhere at the intersection of stats, computers science and machine learning -- but it is building a distinct heft and character of its own.

We will be focusing on the skills and principles needed to build systems for collecting, analyzing and interpreting data.

Major challenge to data science is that it is considerably more subtle that it looks -- Meaningfully analyzing and interpreting data requires both technical expertise and wisdom.

**The heart of data science lies in doing the simple things right: understanding the application domain, cleaning and integrating relevant data sources, and presenting your results clearly to others.**

*simple does not mean easy 

This will all fall under  the * **valuing doing this right**

**Developing mathematical intuition** : Data science rests on the foundations of stats and linear algebra. It is imperative to understand these at the intuitive level: why these concepts were developed, how they are useful, and when they work best.

## Think like a computer scientist, but act like a statistician 

**The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers**

WHat is data science ? It is an emerging field which has been completely defined.

Data science lies at the intersection of computer science, stats and substantive application domains.

From computer science : machine learning, and high-performance computing technologies for dealing with scale.

From Stats: comes a long tradition of exploratory data analysis, significance testing, and visualization. 

From application domains in business and the sciences comes the **evaluation standards** to access when they have been adequately conquered.

Data Science is the new hot thing, mainly because of these three reasons :


**New tech makes it possible to capture, annotate, and store vast amounts of social media, logging and sensor data.After you have amassed all this data, you have to figure out what to do with it.**

**Computing advances make it possible to analyze data in novel ways at ever increasing scales. Cloud gives access on demand, hardware and SaaS. New methods of machine learning.**

**Big tech companies, google, facebook, are using the power of data analytics and have set good examples of success.**

Data Scientists don't think the same way as developers. They need to identify and look at data sets in terms of the potential for usage, and ask the broader questions that the data can answer.**

## 1.1 Computer Science, Data Science and Science

Comp scientists focus on the algorithms that use data. **A data scientist must think like a real scientists** that is just as the regular scientist try to understand and model reality. Computer scientists create their worlds. 

## Cultural differences between computer science and science :

**Data vs method centrism:** Scientists are data driven, Comp Scientists are algorithm driven. Scientists expend time and energy in collecting data to provide insight for their questions. They use measuring devices and create experiments. 

**Computer Scientists** focus on methods/ functions, which algorithm is better, which coding language would be the best fit... the data set is what will be worked on.

**Scientists care about the results** i.e. the answers. They analyze data to discover something about how the world works. Scientists care about whether the results make sense, because they care about what the answer means.

**Computer Scientists *(bad ones)** may be biased to the results, e.g. plausible looking numbers. As soon  as the numbers don't look too bad, he/she will be content. They care about if the result makes sense. e.g. Running unit tests should not take longer than the compilation process, or shouldn't take so long that it causes a significant time delay in the CI/CD pipeline.

**Scientists are comfortable with the idea that data has errors** comp scientists generally are not. Scientists must be concerned about possible bias/errors in the data or how the data was collected. A coder may use a strongly typed language to catch compilation errors, and a suitable parser... but this as far he/she will go in that capacity. **Robustness**

Data can have errors, this should be empowering. Computer scientists are **Garbage in, Garbage out** Scientists make sure their data has integrity.

**Precision** in Math and logic true is true, and false is always false, in science there is still some gray areas. Coders would print the floating point numbers. While scientists will care about the significance of the value, i.e what these values mean. 

**Data Scientist = Scientist** 

Gather data along with the hypothesis for data-driven + hypothesis driven Science, the data is much more granular/resolution and scale, and amount.


# Given a problem, what available data will help us answer it ?

# Given a data set, what interesting problems can we apply it to ?

Coders build systems, while scientists provide insights.

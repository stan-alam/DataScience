**Making Sense of the world around us requires obtaining and analyzing data from our environment**

**Data Science, a new field devoted to maximizing value from vast collections of information**

As a discipline, data science sits somewhere at the intersection of stats, computers science and machine learning -- but it is building a distinct heft and character of its own.

We will be focusing on the skills and principles needed to build systems for collecting, analyzing and interpreting data.

Major challenge to data science is that it is considerably more subtle that it looks -- Meaningfully analyzing and interpreting data requires both technical expertise and wisdom.

**The heart of data science lies in doing the simple things right: understanding the application domain, cleaning and integrating relevant data sources, and presenting your results clearly to others.**

*simple does not mean easy 

This will all fall under  the * **valuing doing this right**

**Developing mathematical intuition** : Data science rests on the foundations of stats and linear algebra. It is imperative to understand these at the intuitive level: why these concepts were developed, how they are useful, and when they work best.

## Think like a computer scientist, but act like a statistician 

**The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers**

WHat is datascience ? It is an emerging field which has been completely defined.

Data science lies at the intersection of computer science, stats and substantive application domains.

From computer science : machine learning, and high-performance computing technologies for dealing with scale.

From Stats: comes a long tradition

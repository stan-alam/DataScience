## notes on the Model Thinker

```text
From the stock market to genomics laboratories, census figures to marketing email
blasts, we are awash with data. But as anyone who has ever opened up a spreadsheet
packed with seemingly infinite lines of data knows, numbers aren’t enough: we need to
know how to make those numbers talk. In The Model Thinker, social scientist Scott E.
Page shows us the mathematical, statistical, and computational models–from linear
regression to random walks and far beyond–that can turn anyone into a genius.
At the core of the book is Page’s “many-model paradigm,” which shows the reader
how to apply multiple models to organize the data, leading to wiser choices, more
accurate predictions, and more robust designs. The Model Thinker provides a toolkit
for business people, students, scientists, pollsters, and bloggers to make them better,
clearer thinkers, able to leverage data and information to their advantage.

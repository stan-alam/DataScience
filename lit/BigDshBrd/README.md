## notes on 'The Big Book of Dashboards'

```text
Comprising dozens of examples that address different industries and departments
(healthcare, transportation, finance, human resources, marketing, customer service,
sports, etc.) and different platforms (print, desktop, tablet, smartphone,
and conference room display) The Big Book of Dashboards is the only book that
matches great dashboards with real-world business scenarios.

By organizing the book based on these scenarios and offering practical and
effective visualization examples, The Big Book of Dashboards will be the trusted 
resource that you open when you need to build an effective business dashboard.

In addition to the scenarios there’s an entire section of the book that is
devoted to addressing many practical and psychological factors you will
encounter in your work. It’s great to have theory and evidenced-based research
at your disposal, but what will you do when somebody asks you to make your dashboard
‘cooler’ by adding packed bubbles and donut charts?

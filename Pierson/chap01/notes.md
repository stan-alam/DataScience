##chapter 01

**Data Science** is a computation science of extracting meaningful insights from raw data and then effectively communicating those insights to to generate value.

**Data Engineering** is an engineering domain that's dedicated to building and maintaining systems that overcome data processing bottlenecks and data handling problems for applications that consume, process, and store large volumes, varieties, and velocities of data.

Commonly three varieties worked by Data Scientists and Data Engineers

  * **Structured Data**: Data is stored, processed, and manipulated in a traditional relational database managements system. (RDBMS) Oracle / MySQL, PostGRES

  * **Unstructured**: Data is usually generated by human activity and doesn't fit into a structured database.

  * **Semistructured** *: Data doesn't fit into a structured database system, but is nonetheless structured by tags that are useful for creating a form of order and hierarchy in the data.

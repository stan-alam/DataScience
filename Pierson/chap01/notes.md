## chapter 01

**Data Science** is a computation science of extracting meaningful insights from raw data and then effectively communicating those insights to to generate value.

**Data Engineering** is an engineering domain that's dedicated to building and maintaining systems that overcome data processing bottlenecks and data handling problems for applications that consume, process, and store large volumes, varieties, and velocities of data.

Commonly three varieties worked by Data Scientists and Data Engineers

  * **Structured Data**: Data is stored, processed, and manipulated in a traditional relational database managements system. (RDBMS) Oracle / MySQL, PostGRES

  * **Unstructured**: Data is usually generated by human activity and doesn't fit into a structured database.

  * **Semistructured** *: Data doesn't fit into a structured database system, but is nonetheless structured by tags that are useful for creating a form of order and hierarchy in the data.

Data and the need for data-informed insights are ubiquitous. e.g. Amazon using machine learning for predicting
buyer's next purchase.
Organizations of all sizes are beginning to recognize that they're immersed in a sink-or-swim, data-driven, competitive environment, data know-how emerges as a core and requisite function in almost every line of business.


 # Who Can use Data Science ?

 **your organization, your employer can**

 Data science represents a change in the way you approach the world. When exacting outcomes, people often used to make their best guess, act, and then hope for their desired result. With data insights, however, people have access to the predictive vision that they need to truly drive change and achieve the results they need.

 **Business Systems** Optimize returns on investments for any measurable activity.

 **Technical marking strategy development** Use data insights and predictive analytics to identify marketing strategies that work, eliminate under-performing efforts, and test new marking strategies.

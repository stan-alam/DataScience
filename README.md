## Data Science

Hierarchy :

**knowledge first -** Get to know your problem, your data, your approach, and your goal before you do anything else, and keep those at the forefront of your mind.

**Technology second -** Software is a tool that serves you. It enables and contains you. It shouldn't dictate your approach to the problem except in extenuating circumstances. 

**Opinions third** Opinions, intuition, and wishful thinking are to be used only as guides toward theories that can be proven correct and not as the focus of any project.

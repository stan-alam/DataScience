## notes on THinking machines

```text
When most of us think about Artificial Intelligence, our minds go
straight to cyborgs, robots, and sci-fi thrillers where machines take
over the world. But the truth is that Artificial Intelligence is already among us.
It exists in our smartphones, fitness trackers, and refrigerators that tell us when
the milk will expire.  In some ways, the future people dreamed of at the World’s Fair
in the 1960s is already here. We’re teaching our machines how to think like humans,
and they’re learning at an incredible rate.

In Thinking Machines, technology journalist Luke Dormehl takes you through the
history of AI and how it makes up the foundations of the machines that think for us
today. Furthermore, Dormehl speculates on the incredible–and possibly terrifying–future
that’s much closer than many would imagine. This remarkable book will invite you to
marvel at what now seems commonplace and to dream about a future in which the scope of
humanity may need to widen to include intelligent machines.

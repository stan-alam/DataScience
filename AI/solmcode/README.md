## notes on Solomon's Code

```text
Whether in medicine, money, or love, technologies powered by forms of artificial
intelligence are playing an increasingly prominent role in our lives. As we cede
more decisions to thinking machines, we face new questions about staying safe,
keeping a job and having a say over the direction of our lives. The answers to
those questions might depend on your race, gender, age, behavior, or nationality.

New AI technologies can drive cars, treat damaged brains and nudge workers to be
more productive, but they also can threaten, manipulate, and alienate us from
others. They can pit nation against nation, but they also can help the global
community tackle some of its greatest challengesâ€•from food crises to global
climate change.

In clear and accessible prose, global trends and strategy adviser Olaf Groth,
AI scientist and social entrepreneur Mark Nitzberg, along with seasoned economics
reporter Dan Zehr, provide a unique human-focused, global view of humanity in a
world of thinking machines.

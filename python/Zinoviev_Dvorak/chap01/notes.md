## Data Analysis Sequence


Data analysis study are generally consistent with a general scientific discovery sequence.

Descriptive is the simplest analysis type: where the data is described by reporting *aggregate* measures, often in visual form. Next the data must be described. This occurs during *exploratory* data analysis, here you will try to find a new relationships between existing variables.

**Inferential analysis** is for taking small data samples to describe for example a larger population.

**Predictive analysis** learn from the past to predict the future.

**Causal analysis** identifies variables that each other.

## Building a data pipeline :

	Creating  a pipeline allows you to work with the data. When the dataset

	gets to a certain size, you will be working on it from disk. It is 

	important to understanding the technique to implement to access the 

	data. This technique will impact how fast you get a result.


## Performing the required shaping :

	The shape of the data is the way it is presented and its characteristics 

	such data type. This is important when performing analysis. Data should

	be shaped the same, like comparing apples to apples. You will also need to 

	shape the data to conform to the algorithms needed to utilize/analyze the

	data.

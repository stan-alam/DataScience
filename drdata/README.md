## notes on Dear Data

```text
Equal parts mail art, data visualization, and affectionate correspondence, Dear Data celebrates
“the infinitesimal, incomplete, imperfect, yet exquisitely human details of life,” in the words of
Maria Popova (Brain Pickings), who introduces this charming and graphically powerful book. For one year,
Giorgia Lupi, an Italian living in New York, and Stefanie Posavec, an American in London,
mapped the particulars of their daily lives as a series of hand-drawn postcards they exchanged
via mail weekly—small portraits as full of emotion as they are data, both mundane and magical.
Dear Data reproduces in pinpoint detail the full year’s set of cards, front and back, providing a
remarkable portrait of two artists connected by their attention to the details of their lives—including
complaints, distractions, phone addictions, physical contact, and desires. These details illuminate the
lives of two remarkable young women and also inspire us to map our own lives, including specific
suggestions on what data to draw and how. A captivating and unique book for designers, artists,
correspondents, friends, and lovers everywhere.
“In other words, “Dear Data” paints a human portrait with data. With each graph and information
map, we get a deeper sense of the authors’ personalities. What emerges from this information
overload is a fascinating catalogue of the complexity of daily living. By tracking such minutiae,
Lupi and Posavec, who both work in information design, reveal the patterns that inform our decisions
and affect our relationships.”

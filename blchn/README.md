## notes on BlockChain

```text
It’s called the blockchain.

The first generation of the digital revolution brought us the Internet of information.
The second genera­tion—powered by blockchain technology—is bringing us the Internet of
value: a new, distributed platform that can help us reshape the world of business and
transform the old order of human affairs for the better.

Blockchain is the ingeniously simple, revolution­ary protocol that allows transactions to be
simul­taneously anonymous and secure by maintaining a tamperproof public ledger of value. Though
it’s the technology that drives bitcoin and other digital cur­rencies, the underlying
framework has the potential to go far beyond these and record virtually everything of
value to humankind, from birth and death certifi­cates to insurance claims and even votes.

Why should you care? Maybe you’re a music lover who wants artists to make a living off
their art. Or a consumer who wants to know where that hamburger meat really came from.
Perhaps you’re an immigrant who’s sick of paying big fees to send money home to loved
ones. Or an entrepreneur looking for a new platform to build a business.

And those examples are barely the tip of the ice­berg. This technology is public, encrypted,
and readily available for anyone to use. It’s already seeing wide­spread adoption in a number
of areas. For example, forty-two (and counting) of the world’s biggest finan­cial institutions,
including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Credit Suisse, have formed a consortium to
investigate the blockchain for speedier and more secure transactions.

As with major paradigm shifts that preceded it, the blockchain will create winners and losers.
And while opportunities abound, the risks of disruption and dislocation must not be ignored.

Don Tapscott, the bestselling author of Wikinomics, and his son, blockchain expert Alex
Tapscott, bring us a brilliantly researched, highly readable, and utterly foundational book
about the future of the modern economy.Blockchain Revolution is the business leaders’ playbook
for the next decade and beyond.

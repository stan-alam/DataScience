## notes on Deep Learning Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series

```text
Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience
and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers
knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify
all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn
complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be
many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning.

The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear
algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning.
It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward
networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and
practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech
recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally,
the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models,
autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition
function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.

Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or
research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.
A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.

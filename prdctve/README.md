## notes on 'Predictive Analysis'

```text
“The Freakonomics of big data.” —Stein Kretsinger, founding executive of Advertising.com;
former lead analyst at Capital One.

This book is easily understood by all readers. Rather than a “how to” for hands-on techies,
the book entices lay-readers and experts alike by covering new case studies and the latest
state-of-the-art techniques.
You have been predicted — by companies, governments, law enforcement, hospitals, and universities.
Their computers say, “I knew you were going to do that!” These institutions are seizing upon the
power to predict whether you’re going to click, buy, lie, or die.

Why? For good reason: predicting human behavior combats financial risk, fortifies healthcare,
conquers spam, toughens crime fighting, and boosts sales.

How? Prediction is powered by the world’s most potent, booming unnatural resource: data.
Accumulated in large part as the by-product of routine tasks, data is the unsalted,
flavorless residue deposited en masse as organizations churn away. Surprise! This heap of
refuse is a gold mine. Big data embodies an extraordinary wealth of experience from which to learn.

Predictive analytics unleashes the power of data. With this technology, the computer
literally learns from data how to predict the future behavior of individuals. Perfect
prediction is not possible, but putting odds on the future — lifting a bit of the fog
off our hazy view of tomorrow — means pay dirt.

A truly omnipresent science, predictive analytics affects everyone, every day.
Although largely unseen, it drives millions of decisions, determining whom to call,
mail, investigate, incarcerate, set up on a date, or medicate.

Predictive analytics transcends human perception. This book’s final chapter answers
the riddle: What often happens to you that cannot be witnessed, and that you can’t
even be sure has happened afterward — but that can be predicted in advance?
Whether you are a consumer of it — or consumed by it — get a handle on the power
of Predictive Analytics.

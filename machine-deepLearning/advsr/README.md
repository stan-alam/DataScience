## adversarial machine learning ( case notes from text )

Synthesis Lectures on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
The increasing abundance of large high-quality datasets, combined
with significant technical advances over the last several decades
have made machine learning into a major tool employed across a broad
array of tasks including vision, language, finance, and security.
However, success has been accompanied with important new challenges:
many applications of machine learning are adversarial in nature.
Some are adversarial because they are safety critical, such as
autonomous driving. An adversary in these applications can be a
malicious party aimed at causing congestion or accidents, or may
even model unusual situations that expose vulnerabilities in the
prediction engine. Other applications are adversarial because their
task and/or the data they use are. For example, an important class of
problems in security involves detection, such as malware, spam, and
intrusion detection. The use of machine learning for detecting malicious
entities creates an incentive among adversaries to evade detection by
changing their behavior or the content of malicius objects they develop.
The field of adversarial machine learning has emerged to study vulnerabilities
of machine learning approaches in adversarial settings and to develop techniques
to make learning robust to adversarial manipulation. This book provides a
technical overview of this field. After reviewing machine learning concepts
and approaches, as well as common use cases of these in adversarial settings,
we present a general categorization of attacks on machine learning. We then
address two major categories of attacks and associated defenses: decision-time
attacks, in which an adversary changes the nature of instances seen by a learned
model at the time of prediction in order to cause errors, and poisoning or
training time attacks, in which the actual training dataset is maliciously
modified. In our final chapter devoted to technical content, we discuss recent
techniques for attacks on deep learning, as well as approaches for improving
robustness of deep neural networks. We conclude with a discussion of several
important issues in the area of adversarial learning that in our view warrant
further research.
Given the increasing interest in the area of adversarial machine learning, we
hope this book provides readers with the tools necessary to successfully engage in
research and practice of machine learning in adversarial settings.

## notes on Deep Thinking: Where Machine Intelligence Ends and Human Creativity Begins

```text
Garry Kasparovâ€™s 1997 chess match against the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue was a
watershed moment in the history of technology. It was the dawn of a new era in
artificial intelligence: a machine capable of beating the reigning human champion
at this most cerebral game.
That moment was more than a century in the making, and in this breakthrough book,
Kasparov reveals his astonishing side of the story for the first time. He describes
how it felt to strategize against an implacable, untiring opponent with the whole
world watching, and recounts the history of machine intelligence through the
microcosm of chess, considered by generations of scientific pioneers to be a key
to unlocking the secrets of human and machine cognition. Kasparov uses his
unrivaled experience to look into the future of intelligent machines and sees it
bright with possibility. As many critics decry artificial intelligence as a menace,
particularly to human jobs, Kasparov shows how humanity can rise to new heights with
the help of our most extraordinary creations, rather than fear them. Deep Thinking
is a tightly argued case for technological progress, from the man who stood at
its precipice with his own career at stake.

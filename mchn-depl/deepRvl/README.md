## notes on Deep Learning Revolution

```text
How deep learning―from Google Translate to driverless cars to personal cognitive
assistants―is changing our lives and transforming every sector of the economy.
The deep learning revolution has brought us driverless cars, the greatly improved
Google Translate, fluent conversations with Siri and Alexa, and enormous profits
from automated trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Deep learning networks can
play poker better than professional poker players and defeat a world champion at Go.
In this book, Terry Sejnowski explains how deep learning went from being an arcane
academic field to a disruptive technology in the information economy.
Sejnowski played an important role in the founding of deep learning, as one of a small
group of researchers in the 1980s who challenged the prevailing logic-and-symbol
based version of AI. The new version of AI Sejnowski and others developed, which
became deep learning, is fueled instead by data. Deep networks learn from data in
the same way that babies experience the world, starting with fresh eyes and gradually
acquiring the skills needed to navigate novel environments. Learning algorithms extract
information from raw data; information can be used to create knowledge; knowledge
underlies understanding; understanding leads to wisdom. Someday a driverless car will
know the road better than you do and drive with more skill; a deep learning network
will diagnose your illness; a personal cognitive assistant will augment your puny
human brain. It took nature many millions of years to evolve human intelligence;
AI is on a trajectory measured in decades. Sejnowski prepares us for a deep learning future.
